This game was made using python 3.6 and Pycharm
using the libraries "pygame" and "SimpleGUICS2Pygame".

(note: nothing which is not avaiable in the simplegui library has
 been used to develop this game. Pygame is simply a a dependancy
 for simplegui, none of the additional features which it can provide
 have been used during the development of this game.)

I believe any version of python 3 will run this game,
however it has only been tested using python 3.6 and 3.7

It is easiest to run this game using pyCharm

(note: this guide assumes you already have a python3 
 interpreter installed on your system.)

1. Open the project folder "myGame" in pyCharm
2. Configure the python interpreter
    - Go to File -> Settings
    - In the set of options of the left, click on "Project: myGame"
    - Click on "Project Interpreter"
    - Click on the drop down box at top of the windows and select "show all"
    - Click on the '+' on the right of the window
    - with "new environment" checked, use the drop down box labelled "base interpreter"
      to locate the python interpreter installed on your system.
    - Once you have selected your python interpreter, click "OK",
      this will create the virtual environment for the python project
    - Once the virtual environment has finished creating, click "OK" again
    - You will now have to install the necessary libraries in order to run the
      graphical interface for the game. Begin by clicking the "+" on the right.
    - In the list of libraries, locate and install "pygame" and "SimpleGUICS2Pygame".
    - Once the libraries have been installed, close the current window, and then click
    - "Apply" in the following window, and then click "OK"
    - You should now be able to run the game by running the module "main.py".
      If there are any issues, simply follow these steps once more to make sure
      nothing has been missed.
